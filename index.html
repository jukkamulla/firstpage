I considered that the painter had no right to paint indistinctly. I dully felt that the object of the painting was missing. And I noticed with surprise and confusion that the picture not only gripped me, but impressed itself ineradicably on my memory. Painting took on a fairy-tale power and splendour." /W. Kandinsky/

            <h2 class="content-header">Wassily Kandinsky</h2>

            <p>Wassily Wassilyevich Kandinsky; 16 December [O.S. 4 December] 1866 – 13 December 1944) was an influential Russian
                painter and art theorist. He is credited with painting one of the first purely abstract works. Born in Moscow,
                Kandinsky spent his childhood in Odessa. He enrolled at the University of Moscow, studying law and economics.
                Successful in his profession—he was offered a professorship (chair of Roman Law) at the University of
                Dorpat—Kandinsky began painting studies (life-drawing, sketching and anatomy) at the age of 30.
            </p>
            <p>In 1896 Kandinsky settled in Munich, studying first at Anton Ažbe's private school and then at the Academy of
                Fine Arts. He returned to Moscow in 1914, after the outbreak of World War I. Kandinsky was unsympathetic to the
                official theories on art in Communist Moscow, and returned to Germany in 1921. There, he taught at the Bauhaus
                school of art and architecture from 1922 until the Nazis closed it in 1933. He then moved to France, where he
                lived for the rest of his life, becoming a French citizen in 1939 and producing some of his most prominent art.
                He died at Neuilly-sur-Seine in 1944.

                Kandinsky was born in Moscow, the son of Lidia Ticheeva and Vasily Silvestrovich Kandinsky, a tea
                merchant.
                Kandinsky learned from a variety of sources while in Moscow. He studied many fields while in school, including
                law and economics. Later in life, he would recall being fascinated and stimulated by colour as a child.
                His fascination with colour symbolism and psychology continued as he grew. In 1889, he was part of an
                ethnographic research group which travelled to the Vologda region north of Moscow. In Looks on the Past, he
                relates that the houses and churches were decorated with such shimmering colours that upon entering them, he
                felt that he was moving into a painting. This experience, and his study of the region's folk art (particularly
                the use of bright colours on a dark background), was reflected in much of his early work. A few years later he
                first likened painting to composing music in the manner for which he would become noted, writing, "Colour is the
                keyboard, the eyes are the hammers, the soul is the piano with many strings. The artist is the hand which plays,
                touching one key or another, to cause vibrations in the soul."

                Living in an apartment in Paris, Kandinsky created his work in a living-room studio. Biomorphic forms with supple,
                non-geometric outlines appear in his paintings—forms which suggest microscopic organisms but express the artist's
                inner life. Kandinsky used original colour compositions, evoking Slavic popular art. He also occasionally mixed
                sand with paint to give a granular, rustic texture to his paintings.
            </p>
            <p>This period corresponds to a synthesis of Kandinsky's previous work in which he used all elements, enriching them.
                In 1936 and 1939 he painted his two last major compositions, the type of elaborate canvases he had not
                produced for many years. Composition IX has highly contrasted, powerful diagonals whose central form gives
                the impression of an embryo in the womb. Small squares of colours and coloured bands stand out against the
                black background of Composition X as star fragments (or filaments), while enigmatic hieroglyphs with pastel
                tones cover a large maroon mass which seems to float in the upper-left corner of the canvas. In Kandinsky’s
                work some characteristics are obvious, while certain touches are more discrete and veiled; they reveal
                themselves only progressively to those who deepen their connection with his work. He intended his forms
                (which he subtly harmonized and placed) to resonate with the observer's soul.
